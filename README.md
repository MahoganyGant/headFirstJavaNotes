## Notes from chapters 2-4 of Head First Java

# Chapter 2: A Trip to Objectville

Objects are like things in the real world, like a chair or a movie. They have states (what they know) and behaviors(what they can do). 
An object is like one entry in an address book. All the pages have a section for the same type of information, but for each address you implement the information is different.

# General steps for creating classes

Write your class, create instances for things in that class (the knows) then the method (what action they perform) test drive your code.

You can create objects from classes. A class is like a blueprint for an object. 

The main method is where your Java program starts running. 

creating your own classes for objects help increase your codes readability and make it easier to make adjustments.

Overriding: Overriding is when a subclass can redefine one of its inherited methods from itâ€™s superclass

# Things Considered when creating a class:
 What attributes do the objects i'll create with this class have in common? What do I want the objects I create with this class to do?

# Things to remember to help me be better at coding:

My job is to tell my objects what I want them to do, I should not worry as much about how they do what they do.

# Chapter 3: Know Your Variables

Variables are like containers that hold information. You should label them with names that help you easily recognize what type of information is stored inside.

Objects are stored on the heap, which is like a big storage area in the computer's memory.

Arrays are like trays of cups that can hold multiple values of the same type.

# Chapter 4: How Objects Behave

You can send information to an object by using methods. 

Methods can also return information back to you. 
Arguments are the things you pass into your methods.

Encapsulation is like hiding the details of an object inside of its class. This makes your code easier to understand and maintain. 

Instance variables are variables that belong to an object. 

Local variables are variables that are only visible inside of a method.
